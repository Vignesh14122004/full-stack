<p>In 1998, the Tatas sold off their 50% stake in Lakmé Cosmetics to Hindustan Lever for ₹200 crore (US$48.46 million), and created Trent with the proceeds from the sale. Simone Tata, the chairperson of Lakmé, went on to head Trent. The company began operations in 1998, after acquiring the only store of Littlewoods in Bangalore and renaming the store "Westside".[5]
Trent operated only Westside stores until 2004, when it opened its first Star Bazaar hypermarket in Ahmedabad.[6][7]
<br>
<p>In 2005, Trent acquired a 76% controlling stake in Landmark Bookstores,[8] a Chennai-based privately owned books and music retailer, and completed 100% acquisition in April 2008.[9]
In 2007, Trent entered a franchisee agreement with Benetton Group to set up Sisley stores in India.[10] In 2008, Trent launched value fashion stores called Fashion Yatra.[11] However, by 2012, the company shut down all Fashion Yatra stores and later terminated its Sisley agreement in an effort to shelve loss-making ventures.[12]
<br>
<p>In 2009, Trent and Inditex established a 49:51 joint venture to run Zara stores in India.[13][14] Two years later, the two companies entered a similar agreement to open Massimo Dutti stores in India.[15]
In 2014, Tesco acquired a 50% stake in Star Bazaar for £85 million and became a joint venture partner.[16][17] After the establishment of the joint venture, Star Bazaar started supermarket format Star Market and small convenience store format Star Daily,[18] but discontinued the latter by early 2018[19] when it began its online grocery service called StarQuik.[20]
